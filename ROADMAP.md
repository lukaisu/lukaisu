# Lukaisu roadmap

Build-and-release roadmap for the app. The local-first architecture plan and the
client⇄server seam live in [`BRIEFING.md`](BRIEFING.md); the F-Droid release
runbook is in [`FDROID.md`](FDROID.md).

## v0.1 — working shell (done)

- [x] Capacitor 8 + system-WebView project, Android platform committed.
- [x] Connect screen: server URL → native `GET /api/v1/version` probe → persist
      in Preferences → navigate the WebView to the server. Relaunch returns to
      the saved server; back-navigation returns to the picker (no auto-connect
      loop); cleartext HTTP allowed for LAN self-hosts; `errorPath` fallback.
- [x] Debug APK builds (JDK 21, Gradle 8.14.3, AGP 8.13.0).

## v0.2 — brand & fit-and-finish (done)

- [x] Locked brand + `applicationId` — **Lukaisu** / `org.lukaisu.app`
      (lukaisu.org registered by the maintainer, 2026-06).
- [x] Brand launcher icons (adaptive + maskable, あ + A open-book mark) and
      light/dark splash, generated with `@capacitor/assets`.
- [x] On-device QA against a real server (login, registration, reading, review,
      audio, dictionary popups, Android Back ergonomics).
- [x] Version scheme: `versionName` = semver "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH",
      `versionCode` = MAJOR\*10000 + MINOR\*100 + PATCH. Set to 0.2.0 / 200.

## v0.3 — F-Droid release pipeline (in progress)

See [`FDROID.md`](FDROID.md) for the full runbook.

- [x] Release signing wired (keystore from `keystore.properties`/env, gitignored,
      with an unsigned fallback).
- [x] Fully-FOSS build — no Google Mobile Services, no proprietary blobs.
- [~] Reproducible-build hygiene: Gradle/AGP/Node/JDK/SDK versions pinned and
      documented; bit-for-bit verification still to confirm.
- [~] Fastlane metadata (`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`): title, descriptions,
      changelog, and icon done. **Remaining:** phone screenshots.
- [ ] Create + back up the release keystore (`keytool`), then `npm run apk:release`.
- [ ] Stand up our own F-Droid repo (fdroidserver, static hosting — e.g.
      `fdroid.lukaisu.org`) and publish the signed release there.
- [ ] Submit to the main F-Droid catalog (expect the "requires server"
      anti-feature note — weaker now the app is local-first).

## v0.4 — local-first app (in progress)

Turn Lukaisu from a thin client that requires a server into a local-first app
that works fully offline, where connecting a server is optional. The plan and the
client⇄server seam are in [`BRIEFING.md`](BRIEFING.md).

The shared reading frontend lives in the sibling **`lukaisu-server`** repo under
`src/frontend/`; this app bundles its build (`dist-app`) via
`npm run sync:model-b`. The local-first data layer (on-device Dexie DB, the
TypeScript parsers, repositories, and first-run seed content) is built there and
consumed here — don't fork it (frontend relocation is a later, coordinated call).

- [x] Bundle the shared frontend (connect → library → reader) from
      `lukaisu-server` instead of fetching server-rendered pages
      (`npm run sync:model-b`).
- [x] On-device DB + TypeScript parsers + repositories so the read/save/review
      loop runs offline for space-separated and RTL languages; first-run seeds
      language presets and sample texts. Verified end-to-end on an Android
      emulator (offline: seed → library → reader → save word → review).
- [ ] Make the bundled local-first build the default: open to the local library,
      and demote "connect a server" to an optional Settings action (keep the
      existing server-probe flow, just no longer mandatory).
- [ ] On-device QA of the full offline slice on physical hardware.
- [ ] CORS onboarding for the optional server path: the bundle is cross-origin,
      so a connected server must set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://localhost` —
      surface this in the connect screen's error copy.

## Later

- [ ] **Sync** (local ⇄ server) — deferred. The local schema keeps per-row
      timestamps + a pending-op store so it can be added without a rewrite; the
      sync design lives in `lukaisu-server/BRIEFING.md`.
- [ ] **High-quality CJK, TTS, transcription, and content discovery without a
      server** — out of scope; these stay server-enhanced (char-by-char CJK
      fallback offline).
- [ ] **Play Store variant** with a default public instance.
